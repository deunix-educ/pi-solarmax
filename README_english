Under the brand name "SolarMax" sells the Swiss company 
Sputnik Engineering AG photovoltaic inverter. 

The SolarMax inverters can be customized with normal Ethernet connection 
query, taking advantage of a (sort of) text-based protocol over 
a TCP connection. 

The protocol used was reverse engineered by me (using 
Network-capturing using the MaxTalk software). 

Only after implementation of the basic functionality I received yet 
still a documentation of the protocol used by the manufacturer. 
The license of this interface description, however, does not allow
